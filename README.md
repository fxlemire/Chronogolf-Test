#### Technical Test - Frontend Developer
# Refactoring an AngularJS Directive

## Context

This test is based on the scenario where you need to refactor an old piece of code. The directive provides a form that suggests existing users thanks to autocompletion. Assume that this component lives in a library of components inside a complex app.

## Tasks

- Convert the AngularJS directive to an Angular component
- Call the list of customer with an HTTP request
- Improve the quality of the component's code
- Write tests relative to your component
- Use a pull request to suggest your solution

## Bonus

We understand time is scarce, so here are optional tasks we would like you to address either in code or during the interview:

- Using Typescript
- Improvement to the application's structure
- Improvement to the tooling
